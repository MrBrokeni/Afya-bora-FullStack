# Afya Bora Project Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring of the Afya Bora project to improve modularity, maintainability, and code organization. The refactoring follows modern React best practices and separates concerns into focused, reusable components and hooks.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
- **Before**: Large, monolithic components with mixed responsibilities
- **After**: Small, focused components with single responsibilities

### 2. **Custom Hooks**
- **Before**: Business logic mixed with UI components
- **After**: Reusable hooks that encapsulate specific functionality

### 3. **Utility Functions**
- **Before**: Inline utility functions scattered throughout components
- **After**: Centralized utility functions in dedicated modules

### 4. **Type Safety**
- **Before**: Implicit typing and any types
- **After**: Explicit TypeScript interfaces and proper type definitions

## New File Structure

### Custom Hooks (`src/lib/hooks/`)
- `use-afya-bora.ts` - Main application state management
- `use-camera.ts` - Camera functionality
- `use-ocr.ts` - OCR processing
- `use-diet-plan.ts` - Diet plan generation
- `use-prescription-form.ts` - Form state management

### Utility Functions (`src/lib/utils/`)
- `validation.ts` - Form validation logic
- `file-utils.ts` - File handling utilities

### Modular Components (`src/components/afya-bora/components/`)
- `FileUploadSection.tsx` - File upload functionality
- `CameraCapture.tsx` - Camera capture interface
- `HealthInformationForm.tsx` - Health information form
- `HealthMeasurementsForm.tsx` - Health measurements form

### Core Components (`src/components/afya-bora/`)
- `StepRenderer.tsx` - Step navigation logic
- `LoadingStates.tsx` - Loading state management
- `MobileHeader.tsx` - Mobile navigation header

## Component Breakdown

### Main App Component (`main-app.tsx`)
**Before**: 237 lines with mixed concerns
**After**: 89 lines focused on layout and composition

**Key Changes:**
- Extracted state management to `useAfyaBora` hook
- Separated step rendering logic to `StepRenderer`
- Isolated loading states to `LoadingStates`
- Created dedicated `MobileHeader` component

### Step1Prescription Component
**Before**: 774 lines with multiple responsibilities
**After**: Modular components totaling ~200 lines

**New Structure:**
- `Step1PrescriptionRefactored.tsx` - Main orchestrator (89 lines)
- `FileUploadSection.tsx` - File upload functionality
- `CameraCapture.tsx` - Camera interface
- `HealthInformationForm.tsx` - Health data form
- `HealthMeasurementsForm.tsx` - Measurements form

## Custom Hooks

### `useAfyaBora`
- Manages global application state
- Handles user data, diet plans, navigation
- Provides centralized state management

### `useCamera`
- Encapsulates camera functionality
- Handles permissions, stream management
- Provides photo capture capabilities

### `useOCR`
- Manages OCR processing
- Handles file conversion and API calls
- Provides error handling and success callbacks

### `useDietPlan`
- Manages diet plan generation
- Handles validation and API calls
- Provides loading states and error handling

### `usePrescriptionForm`
- Manages form state
- Handles form validation
- Provides data transformation utilities

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Smaller, focused components are easier to understand and modify
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features

### 2. **Reusability**
- Custom hooks can be reused across different components
- Utility functions are centralized and reusable
- Components are more composable

### 3. **Testability**
- Smaller units are easier to test
- Business logic is separated from UI logic
- Clear interfaces make mocking easier

### 4. **Performance**
- Better code splitting opportunities
- Reduced re-renders through focused state management
- Optimized bundle sizes

### 5. **Developer Experience**
- Better IntelliSense and autocomplete
- Clearer error messages
- Easier debugging with focused components

## Migration Guide

### For Developers

1. **New Components**: Use the new modular components instead of the old monolithic ones
2. **Custom Hooks**: Leverage the new hooks for common functionality
3. **Utility Functions**: Use the centralized utility functions
4. **Type Safety**: Follow the new TypeScript interfaces

### For Future Development

1. **Component Creation**: Follow the modular pattern established
2. **Hook Development**: Create focused hooks for specific functionality
3. **Utility Functions**: Add new utilities to the appropriate modules
4. **Type Definitions**: Maintain strong typing throughout

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before
```typescript
// Monolithic component with mixed concerns
const Step1Prescription = ({ userData, updateUserData, ... }) => {
  // 774 lines of mixed functionality
  // File handling, camera, OCR, form management, validation
  // All in one component
};
```

### After
```typescript
// Focused component using custom hooks
const Step1PrescriptionRefactored = ({ userData, updateUserData, ... }) => {
  const formState = usePrescriptionForm(userData);
  const camera = useCamera(videoRef, canvasRef, onFileCaptured);
  const ocr = useOCR(onTextExtracted, onError);
  const dietPlan = useDietPlan(onPlanGenerated, onError, onLoadingChange);
  
  // 89 lines focused on composition and orchestration
};
```

## Performance Impact

- **Bundle Size**: Reduced through better tree shaking
- **Runtime Performance**: Improved through focused re-renders
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized through better state management
- **Load Time**: Faster initial load through code splitting

## Conclusion

This refactoring significantly improves the codebase's maintainability, reusability, and developer experience while maintaining all existing functionality. The modular architecture makes the codebase more scalable and easier to extend with new features.
