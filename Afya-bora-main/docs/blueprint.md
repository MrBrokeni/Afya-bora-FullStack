## Core Features:

- Prescription Parsing: Allow users to upload prescription files (PDF or image) and parse the information using OCR.
- Patient Data Collection: Gather information about the user, including any food allergies or intolerances, any chronic conditions, age, weight, and typical daily activity level.
- Personalized Diet Plan Generation: Generate a personalized 7-day diet plan, offering substitutes, preparation tips and portions, that takes into account the userâ€™s uploaded prescription, any dietary restrictions, calorie targets and macronutrient ratios, balances blood sugar and blood pressure, and utilizes local Tanzanian produce to minimize costs. The tool converts ingredients and labels to Swahili.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A saturated light-green (#66BB6A), for health and vitality.
- Background color: Off-white (#F0F4F0), to make other content 'pop' and to reinforce a clean, healthy feel.
- Accent color: Yellow-green (#9CCC65), to add some flair without detracting from the peaceful color story.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), since this application needs to feel modern but still accessible.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent food categories, exercise types, and vendor options. Follow Material Design guidelines for consistency.
- Use a mobile-first, vertical layout with full-width inputs and clear separation between steps. Employ a 'progress dot' sidebar for navigation.
- Use subtle animations for loading states and transitions to maintain user engagement without causing distraction.
